### Hello! My name is Bruno Coelho üëãüèæ


I'm a data engineer passionate about turning information into valuable insights using tools such as Python, Spark, PySpark, SQL, Hive, and Hadoop to extract the maximum value from data.

With a background in law and business administration, in addition to a course in Analysis and Systems Development, I have the ability to see beyond technology and understand the purpose of data from a broader perspective. This background allows me not only to analyze data but also to advocate for it and present ideas more comprehensively.

Beyond my work, I am a fervent enthusiast of topics related to data science and machine learning. I am constantly studying and seeking new knowledge to enhance my skills and contribute to innovative projects.

I am always open to new opportunities for collaboration and learning!
